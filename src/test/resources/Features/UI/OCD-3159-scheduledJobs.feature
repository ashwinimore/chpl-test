Feature: OCD-3159 - Types of Jobs listed in Scheduled Jobs page
  This test checks whether the correct jobs are listed in scheduled jobs page based on user role

Scenario Outline: For ROLE_ADMIN verify whether the correct jobs are listed in scheduled jobs page
    Given I'm logged in as "ROLE_ADMIN"
    And I'm on Scheduled Jobs page
    Then I see types of jobs with "<Job Name>" , "<Description>" , "<ONC-ACB specific>" and "<Job Type>"
     Examples:

Scenario: For ROLE_ACB verify that System job does not exist in scheduled jobs page
    Given I'm logged in as "ROLE_ACB"
    And I'm on Scheduled Jobs page
    Then I do not see "System job" listed in scheduled jobs page
